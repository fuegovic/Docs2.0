## Blog Posts

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the blog! It is the perfect place to gather information that might change over time, or that can't be maintained by the team. Here's how to get started.

### Author Profile

Before creating your first post, you'll need an author profile.

<Callout title="Prefer to stay anonymous?">
  If you really don't want to create a user profile, there's an "anon" profile you can attach to
  your blog post: - `authorid: anon`
</Callout>

To create an author profile:

- Create the profile page in `pages/authors`.
- Name the file following this format: `authorid.mdx`.
- Add your profile picture in `public/images/people`.
- Follow this template:

```mdx filename="authorid.mdx"
---
title: Your Name Profile
authorid: your-authorid
subtitle: Job Title or Short Description
name: Your Name
bio: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla litora ridiculus magna et etiam mi. Dolor etiam id elit morbi ipsum mauris. Non dapibus urna platea elementum fusce vulputate.

socials:
  GitHub: https://github.librechat.ai
  LinkedIn: https://linkedin.librechat.ai/
  X: https://x.com/LibreChatAI
  Discord: https://discord.librechat.ai
  YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@LibreChat
---

import AuthorProfile from '@/components/Author/AuthorProfile'

<AuthorProfile authorId="your-authorid" />
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">
  Use the other authorid files in `pages/authors` as reference.
</Callout>

### Make your first blog post!

We are using MDX for the blog. MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

For more info, see: https://mdxjs.com/

- Blog post thumbnail image (required)

  - Use either an image hosted on GitHub or place your image(s) in `public/images/blog`.
  - Use the same name for your thumbnail image and your blog post file.
  - If you want to include more images than just the thumbnail, make a folder with the same name as your blog post MDX file and put all images (including the thumbnail) in that folder.

- The blog posts are placed in `pages/blog`.
- Use the following naming scheme to keep it organized: "date-short_title".

  - `yyyy-mm-dd_short_title.mdx`

- Add the metadata and the header to your new document:

  ```mdx filename="metadata and header"

  title: Your Awesome Title
  date: 2024/01/01

  tags: - tag1 - tag2
  authorid: your-authorid

  import { BlogHeader } from '@/components/blog/BlogHeader'

  {' '}

  <BlogHeader />
  ```

- **Start writing!** üßë‚Äçüíª

<Callout type="warning" title="Before you submit">
### Before you submit a PR for your blog post, **always** test to make sure everything looks fine.

#### Look at:

- Your author profile
- The blog landing page
- Your blog post

#### How to test:

- Prepare the environment
  - `pnpm install`
- Run the dev server
  - `pnpm dev`
- Test the build
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm start`

</Callout>

## Changelog and Breaking Changes

Posting changelog and breaking changes should be reserved for the team and frequent contributors.

The procedure is basically the same as with the blog posts, with a couple of notable differences:

- Post location: `pages/changelog`.
- Thumbnail: optional, but should be included for major releases.
  - Thumbnail location: `public/images/changelog`.
- Filename:
  - Changelog: `v0.0.0.mdx`.
  - Breaking changes: `v0.0.0-breaking-changes.mdx`.
- No author profile necessary.

- Changelog Metadata and Header:

  ```mdx filename="changelog metadata and header"
  ---
  date: 1999/01/01
  title: üöÄ LibreChat v0.0.0
  description: The v0.0.0 release of LibreChat
  ogImage: /images/changelog/v0.0.0.png
  ---

  import { ChangelogHeader } from '@/components/changelog/ChangelogHeader'

  {' '}

  <ChangelogHeader />

  ---
  ```

- Breaking Changes Metadata and Header:

  ```mdx filename="breaking changes metadata and header"
  ---
  date: 1999/01/02
  title: ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes v0.0.0+
  description: Breaking Changes for the v0.0.0+ release of LibreChat
  ---

  import { ChangelogHeader } from '@/components/changelog/ChangelogHeader'

  {' '}

  <ChangelogHeader />

  ---
  ```

<Callout type="note" title="Notes:">
  - Breaking changes posts are dated one day after the changelog posts. 
  - Use a separator: `---` after the header: `<ChangelogHeader />`.
</Callout>
