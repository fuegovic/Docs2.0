# Welcome, Aspiring Blog Contributors! üôå

Are you eager to share your expertise and insights with our vibrant community? Contributing to our blog is a fantastic way to do just that! In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your first blog post and making your mark on our platform. Let's dive in! üåü

## Step 1: Set Up Your Author Profile üë§

Before you start crafting your blog post, you'll need to create an author profile. This helps our readers get to know the brilliant mind behind the content. Here's how:

1. Create a new file in the `pages/authors` directory, following the format `authorid.mdx`.
2. Add your profile picture to the `public/images/people` folder.
3. Fill in the template with your details, including your name, bio, and social media links.

<Callout title="Prefer to Stay Anonymous?">
  No worries! If you'd rather not create a personal profile, you can use the "anon" profile by adding `authorid: anon` to your blog post metadata.
</Callout>

```mdx filename="authorid.mdx"

import AuthorProfile from '@/components/Author/AuthorProfile'

<AuthorProfile authorId="your-authorid" />
```

## Step 2: Craft Your Blog Post ‚úçÔ∏è

Now, it's time to let your creativity flow! We use MDX for our blog posts, which allows you to seamlessly blend markdown and JSX. This means you can create interactive and engaging content by importing components like charts and alerts.

To create your blog post:

1. Place your post in the `pages/blog` directory, using the naming scheme `yyyy-mm-dd_short_title.mdx`.
2. Add a thumbnail image to the `public/images/blog` folder, using the same name as your blog post file.
3. Include the necessary metadata and header in your document, as shown in the example.
4. Let your thoughts and ideas pour onto the page! üéâ

  ```mdx filename="metadata and header"

## Step 3: Test and Submit Your Post üöÄ

Before submitting your blog post, it's crucial to ensure everything looks perfect. Take a moment to review your author profile, the blog landing page, and your post itself.

To test your changes:

1. Prepare the environment by running `pnpm install`.
2. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Build the project using `pnpm build` and `pnpm start`.

Once you're confident everything is in order, submit a pull request, and our team will review your contribution. We can't wait to see what you've created! üòä
