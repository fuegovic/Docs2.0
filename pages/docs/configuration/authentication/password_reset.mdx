# Email and Password Reset
For a quick overview, refer to the user guide provided here: [Password Reset](/docs/user_guides/password_reset)

## General setup

**Basic Configuration**

If you want to use one of the predefined services, configure only these variables:
For more info about supported email services: https://community.nodemailer.com/2-0-0-beta/setup-smtp/well-known-services/

<OptionTable
  options={[
    ['EMAIL_SERVICE', 'string', 'Name of the email service (e.g. Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, ProtonMail, iCloud Mail).'],
    ['EMAIL_USERNAME', 'string', 'Username of the email service (usually the email address, but can be a separate username).'],
    ['EMAIL_PASSWORD', 'string', 'Password used to access the email service (not the email account password).'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM', 'string', 'Email address that will appear in the "from" field when a user receives an email.'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM_NAME', 'string', 'Name that will appear in the "from" field when a user receives an email. Defaults to the app title if left unset.'],
  ]}
/>

**Advanced Configuration**

If you want to use a generic SMTP service or need advanced configuration for one of the predefined providers, configure these variables as well:

<OptionTable
  options={[
    ['EMAIL_HOST', 'string', 'Hostname to connect to, or an IP address.'],
    ['EMAIL_PORT', 'integer', 'Port to connect to. Note that different ports have different requirements (e.g. 25 for mailserver-to-mailserver, 465 for encryption at the start of the connection, and 587 for submission of mail as a user).'],
    ['EMAIL_ENCRYPTION', 'string', 'Defines if encryption is required at the start (tls) or started after the connection is set up (starttls). If set, it will be enforced.'],
    ['EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_HOSTNAME', 'string', 'Specifies a hostname against which the certificate is validated. Use this if the mail server has a valid certificate, but you are connecting with an IP or a different name.'],
    ['EMAIL_ALLOW_SELFSIGNED', 'boolean', 'Allows self-signed certificates to be accepted from the server. ONLY use this for testing, as it reduces security. Defaults to `false`.'],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
**Failing to perform either of the below setups will result in LibreChat using the unsecured password reset! This allows anyone to reset any password on your server immediately, without mail being sent at all!**
</Callout>

## Setup with Gmail

To set up Gmail, follow these steps:

1. Create a Google Account and enable 2-step verification.
2. In the **[Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)**, click on the "Security" tab and open "2-step verification."
3. Scroll down and open "App passwords." Choose "Mail" for the app and select "Other" for the device, then give it a random name.
4. Click on "Generate" to create a password, and copy the generated password.
5. In the `.env` file, modify the variables as follows:

<OptionTable
  options={[    
    ['EMAIL_SERVICE', 'string', 'gmail'],
    ['EMAIL_USERNAME', 'string', 'your-email'],
    ['EMAIL_PASSWORD', 'string', 'your-app-password'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM', 'string', 'email address for the from field, e.g., noreply@librechat.ai'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM_NAME', 'string', 'My LibreChat Server'],
  ]}
/>

## Setup with custom mail server

To set up a custom mail server, follow these steps:

1. Gather your SMTP login data from your provider. The steps are different for each, but they will usually list values for all variables.
2. In the `.env` file, modify the variables as follows, assuming some sensible example values:

<OptionTable
  options={[    ['EMAIL_HOST', 'string', 'Hostname to connect to, e.g., mail.example.com'],
    ['EMAIL_PORT', 'integer', 'Port to connect to, e.g., 587'],
    ['EMAIL_ENCRYPTION', 'string', 'Encryption type, e.g., starttls'],
    ['EMAIL_USERNAME', 'string', 'Your email username'],
    ['EMAIL_PASSWORD', 'string', 'Your app password'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM', 'string', 'Email address for the from field, e.g., noreply@librechat.ai'],
    ['EMAIL_FROM_NAME', 'string', 'Name that will appear in the "from" field, e.g., "My LibreChat Server"'],
  ]}
/>
