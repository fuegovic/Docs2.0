# Advanced Docker Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for installing, configuring, and managing LibreChat using Docker Compose. It covers advanced topics and configurations to help you set up and customize LibreChat according to your needs.

For the short version, please consult: [Docker Install](/docs/local/docker)

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Git
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the LibreChat repository to your desired location:

```sh filename="Clone the repository"
git clone https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat.git
```

## Configuration

### Creating the .env File

1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```sh filename="Navigate to the repository"
   cd LibreChat
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:

   ```sh filename="Create the .env file"
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and provide the necessary configurations. Refer to the [AI Setup](/docs/configuration/pre_configured_ai) and [Custom Endpoints & Configuration](../configuration/custom_config.md#docker-setup) guides for more information. //TODO

### Setting up AI Endpoints (Required)

At least one AI endpoint should be set up for LibreChat to function properly. Follow the [AI Setup](/docs/configuration/pre_configured_ai) guide to configure your desired AI endpoints.

### Customizing Endpoints and Configuration (Optional)

If you want to customize AI endpoints, such as Mistral AI, or other settings, refer to the [Custom Endpoints & Configuration](../configuration/custom_config.md#docker-setup) guide. //TODO

### Managing MongoDB Database (Optional)

LibreChat uses MongoDB as its database. If you want to manage your MongoDB database using Mongo Express, follow the [Manage Your MongoDB Database](/blog/2023-11-30_mongoexpress) guide.

### Setting up User Authentication System (Optional)

If you want to enable user authentication and Google login in LibreChat, follow the [User Authentication System Setup](/docs/configuration/authentication) guide.

## Running LibreChat

Once you have completed the necessary configurations, you can start the LibreChat application by running the following command:

```sh filename="Start LibreChat"
docker compose up -d
```

After running this command, you can access the LibreChat application at http://localhost:3080.

## Updating LibreChat

To update LibreChat to the latest version, follow these steps:

```sh filename="Stop the running container(s)"
docker compose down
```
```sh filename="Pull the latest project changes"
git pull
```
```sh filename="Pull the latest LibreChat image"
docker compose pull
```
```sh filename="Start LibreChat"
docker compose up -d
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Modifying docker-compose.yml

While you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file directly, it's recommended to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file instead. This allows you to override the default configuration without modifying the main `docker-compose.yml` file, making it easier to update LibreChat in the future.

For more information on modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file, refer to the [Docker Override](/docs/configuration/docker_override) guide and the official Docker documentation:

- [Understanding Multiple Compose Files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files)
- [Merging Compose Files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/merge/#merge-compose-files)
- [Specifying Multiple Compose Files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/#specifying-multiple-compose-files)

### Creating a MongoDB Database (Optional)

If you don't want to use the local MongoDB database installed by Docker, you can create a separate MongoDB database. Refer to the [MongoDB Atlas](/docs/configuration/mongodb/mongodb_atlas) or the [MongoDB Community Server](/docs/configuration/mongodb/mongodb_atlas) guide for instructions, as well as the [Docker Override Guide](/docs/configuration/docker_override) for the implementation.
