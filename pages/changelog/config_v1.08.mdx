# v1.0.8

- Added additional fields to [interface config](./custom_config.md#interface-object-structure) to toggle access to specific features:
    - `endpointsMenu`, `modelSelect`, `parameters`, `sidePanel`, `presets`
- Now ensures the following fields always have defaults set:
    - `cache`, `imageOutputType`, `fileStrategy`, `registration`
- Added [`modelSpecs`](./custom_config.md#model-specs-object-structure) for a configurable UI experience, simplifying model selection with specific presets and tools.
- Added [`filteredTools`](./custom_config.md#filteredtools) to disable specific plugins/tools without any changes to the codebase
    - Affects both `gptPlugins` and `assistants` endpoints
- [`iconURL`](./custom_config.md#iconurl) can now be to set to one of the main endpoints to use existing project icons
    - "openAI" | "azureOpenAI" | "google" | "anthropic" | "assistants" | "gptPlugins"
- Invalid YAML format is now logged for easier debugging
